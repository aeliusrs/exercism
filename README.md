# OCaml

Ocaml is a language I discovered at School 42.
It my first Functional programming and it's my favorites programming
language.

I've also trained  on Elixir/Erlang.

# x86 ASM
After 42, and two years working as DevOps consultant,
I realised that I miss some core concept of CS.

So I've naturally start to fill the gap with online content.

Doing ASM programming is a part of this effort to know better about
computer.
